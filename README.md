## Introduction 👋
Hi! My name is Alexander Manalad. I am a rising software engineer with interests in full stack development and software development.

## About Me 😎
- Full Stack Technologies I use: React, Node.js, TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Fundamental Languages I use: Python, C++, Java, C#
- Currently looking for any experience or internships to enhance my coding skills. 👀
- A 3rd year-junior student attending CSULB for Computer Science B.S. and graduating by 2027. 🎓
- Building and Learning Full Stack Development currently:
  - ✔️ HTML/CSS
  - ✔️ TypeScript/JavaScript
  - 📈 Frontend: React (WIP)
  - 📈 Backend: Node.js (WIP)
  - 📈 Database: SQL (PostgreSQL - WIP)
- <b>Fun Fact:</b> I love video games and is inspired by Minecraft. 🎮

## Tech Interests: Why both Full Stack and Software Development? ⭐
The duality in interests of software development and full stack development align towards its creativity and a deep curiousity about how technologies work from a low-end architecture to an end-user experience.
- To architect holistically is by means a system design understanding; how backend performance correlates and impacts frontend responsiveness.
- To bridge technical implementations with intuitive interfaces shows a pleasant user experience; ensures solutions are thoughtful and friendly at the end of the day.
- To iterate and innovate the UMPIRE process from problem tackling to building multiple solutions not only slowly refines but represents a final product with growing value.

These train of thoughts towards my tech interests are the reaons why I contribute to open source projects in relation to full stack and software development! ❤️‍🔥
